If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services.

In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

                 <p class="lh-base text-dark ">Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you.

                    to the processing of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) 
                    you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of 
                    the processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the 
                    accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain 
                    circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information 
                    for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of 
                    your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.

How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your personal information.</p>
